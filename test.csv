As a person who has both interests and education in multidisciplinary humanities, l can appreciate why phenomenoa like this exists, l understand that people in smaller towns feel betrayed, forgotten and abandoned due to lack of founding, limited access to jobs and education and as a result of the above they tend to divert their frustrations towards immigration being the easiest target, and someone to blame for their hardships and misfortunes. 

I understand how easy it is to manipulate an angry and frustrated group of people and bend them into any shape required by the powers above, but even with all that in mind, l am terrified because in here- this little town in Fenlands, the hatred, the racism and the rise of far right is spreading like an unstoppable wildfire. 

People here are having racist rants in the shops, cafes, bank ques, high street, doctors waiting rooms. Business proudly pledge their allegiance to the likes of Stephen Yaxley- Lennon, Reform and anyone that preaches racist hatred by displaying flags, slogans and posters with racist rethoric and no one is even remotely ashamed of it either, on the contrary.

I'm observing it all somewhat with disbelief and oftentimes in sheer horror. It really breaks my spirit and l quite often don't know how to react to it anymore. It makes me feel hopeless."	1934	1609

He recently placed an order for the 512gb OLED, however when he opened the package the deck had been replaced with an extension cable. Someone who works for the courier has clearly recognised the box, made the swap and resealed the package (the box also has two strips of tape to back this up, which was sent to valve). This was purchased directly from valve so the issue was raised with them on two separate tickets but both times they have said there is nothing they can do about it as they sent the package correctly and it was marked as delivered. He has filed a police report (valve are also aware of this and he offered to provide a crime reference) and contacted his bank and the courier but so far hasn’t heard back. He doesn’t use reddit so I suggested making a post to see if anyone here has any advice of anything more he can do? Thanks to all for any help in advance. 	221	972
100	Arxiv	The electronic structure of cuprates from high energy spectroscopy	Mark S. Golden	2000-11-15	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0011267v1	We report studies of the electronic structure and elementary excitations of doped and undoped cuprate chains, ladders and planes. Using high energy spectroscopies such as x-ray absorption, core level photoemission and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy, important information regarding the charge distribution and hole dynamics can be obtained. The comparison of the experimental data with suitable theoretical models sets constraints on the parameters entering into the model calculations, and offers insight into the important physical quantities governing the electronic structure of these materials. Recurring themes include the importance of the dimensionality of the Cu-O network (1D->2D) and the crucial role played by the spin-background in determining the dynamics of low-lying excitations in these strongly correlated systems.

Garcia-Lekue	2002-11-14	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0211289v1	Surface effects on the electronic energy loss of charged particles entering a metal surface are investigated within linear-response theory, in the framework of time-dependent density functional theory. Interesting phenomena occur in the loss spectra originated by the boundary (bregenzung) effect, which is as a consequence of the orthogonality of surface and bulk excitation modes. Our calculations indicate that the presence of a non-abrupt electron-density profile at the surface severely affects the nature of surface excitations, as deduced from comparison with simplified models.

102	Arxiv	A geometrical meaning to the electron mass from breakdown of Lorentz invariance	Fabio Cardone	2005-05-16	http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0505137v1	We discuss the problem of the electron mass in the framework of Deformed Special Relativity (DSR), a generalization of Special Relativity based on a deformed Minkowski space (i.e. a four-dimensional space-time with metric coefficients depending on the energy). We show that, by such a formalism, it is possible to derive the value of the electron mass from the space-time geometry via the experimental knowledge of the parameter of local Lorentz invariance breakdown, and of the Minkowskian threshold energy $E_{0,em}$ for the electromagnetic interaction. We put forward the suggestion that mass generation can be related, in DSR, to the possible dependence of mass on the metric background (relativity of mass).	Alessio Marrani et Roberto Mignani	712
103	Arxiv	Ultrafast Electron Dynamics in the Topological Insulator Bi2Se3 Studied by Time-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy	Jonathan A. Sobota	2014-01-14	http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3078v2	We characterize the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ using time- and angle- resolved photoemission spectroscopy. By employing two-photon photoemission, a complete picture of the unoccupied electronic structure from the Fermi level up to the vacuum level is obtained. We demonstrate that the unoccupied states host a second, Dirac surface state which can be resonantly excited by 1.5 eV photons. We then study the ultrafast relaxation processes following optical excitation. We find that they culminate in a persistent non-equilibrium population of the first Dirac surface state, which is maintained by a meta-stable population of the bulk conduction band. Finally, we perform a temperature-dependent study of the electron-phonon scattering processes in the conduction band, and find the unexpected result that their rates decrease with increasing sample temperature. We develop a model of phonon emission and absorption from a population of electrons, and show that this counter-intuitive trend is the natural consequence of fundamental electron-phonon scattering processes. This analysis serves as an important reminder that the decay rates extracted by time-resolved photoemission are not in general equal to single electron scattering rates, but include contributions from filling and emptying processes from a continuum of states.

104	Arxiv	Electronic and magnetic properties of the graphene densely decorated with 3d metallic adatoms	Malgorzata Wawrzyniak-Adamczewska	2017-11-27	http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09828v1	The electronic properties of graphene decorated with Ni, Co, Cu and Zn adatoms is studied with the density functional theory approach. Within the analysis the spin-orbit interaction is taken into account. We focus on the case when the indicated $3d$ metallic adatoms form a perfect, close-packed single-atomic layer above the graphene surface. The two configurations are examined, namely the adatoms in the on-top, and the hollow positions on graphene. First, we verify that the metallic adatoms in the close-packed structure do not form a covalent bonds with the graphene substrate. However, due to the proximity of the metallic adatoms to the graphene, the charge transfer from the adatom layer to the graphene takes place, and in consequence the graphene becomes $n$-doped. The observed charge transfer results from the arising hybridization between the graphene $2p$ and transition metal $3d$ orbitals. The proximity of metallic adatoms modifies the magnetic state of the graphene. This effect is especially pronounced for the decoration with magnetic atoms, when the magnetic moments on the graphene sublattices are induced. The analysis of the band structure demonstrates that the charge transfer, as well as the induced magnetism on graphene, modify the graphene electronic properties near high symmetry points, especially the Dirac cones. The presence of the metallic adatoms breaks graphene $K-K^{'}$ symmetry and splits the bands due to the exchange coupling. We show that for the hollow configuration the gap opening arises at the $K(K^{'})$-point due to the Rashba-like spin-orbit interaction, while in the case of the on-top configuration the energy gap opens mainly due to the staggered potential. We also mapped the parameters of an effective Hamiltonian on the results obtained with the density functional theory approach.	Aucun	1838
105	Arxiv	Effect of discrete impurities on electron transport in ultra-short MOSFET using 3D Monte Carlo simulation	P. Dollfus	2003-10-30	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0310718v2	This paper discusses the influence of the channel impurity distribution on the transport and the drive current in short-gate MOSFET. In this purpose, a careful description of electron-ion interaction suitable for the case of discrete impurities has been implemented in a 3D particle Monte Carlo simulator. This transport model is applied to the investigation of 50 nm MOSFET operation. The results show that a small change in the number of doping impurities or in the position of a single discrete impurity in the inversion layer may significantly influence the drain current. This effect is not only related to threshold voltage fluctuations but also to variations in transport properties in the inversion layer, especially at high drain voltage. The results are analyzed in terms of local fluctuations of electron velocity and current density. In a set of fifteen simulated devices the drive current Ion, determined at VGS = VDS = 0.6 V, is found to vary in a range of 23% according to the position of channel impurities.	A. Bournel et S.

The low energy excitations are discussed with emphasis on some of the most recent issues, such as the Fermi surface and remnant Fermi surface, the pseudogap and d-wave-like dispersion, and lastly the signatures in the ARPES spectra of multiple electronic components, many body effects, and the superfluid density. We will focus on systematic changes in the electronic structure which may be relevant to the development of a comprehensive picture for the evolution from Mott insulators to overdoped superconductors.

109	Arxiv	Radiation of the electron bunch moving in non-regular fields	Lekdar Gevorgian	2012-01-12	http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2815v2	The problem of spontaneous radiation of the electron bunch grazing into a charged metallic surface with randomly distributed needle shaped asperities is considered. Distances between two neighboring asperities have been described by gamma distribution. Being repealed by highly charged asperities the electrons of the bunch move along non-regular periodical trajectories in the planes parallel to the metallic surface. The spatial periods of the trajectories are random quantities which are described by the same gamma distribution. The radiation characteristics of the bunch have been obtained. It is shown that the angular distributions of the number of photons radiated from the bunch and from a single electron are the same but the frequency distribution of the bunch is being drastically changed at the hard frequency region. It is proposed to develop a new non-destructive method for investigation of the metal surface roughness. The frequency distribution of the number of photons radiated under the zero angle has been obtained. That allows to find the gain expression of the stimulated radiation.	Valeri Vardanyan	1105

The availability of such an algorithm is essential for the investigation of broken-symmetry phases of interacting electron systems and for the computation of transport properties within the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The algorithm enables us to calculate the optical conductivity fully consistently on a regular lattice, e.g., for the semi-elliptical (Bethe) DOS.

111	Arxiv	Pseudogap and Kinetic Pairing Under Critical Differentiation of Electrons in Cuprate Superconductors	Masatoshi Imada	2000-08-03	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0008050v2	Superconducting mechanism of cuprates is discussed in the light of the proximity of the Mott insulator. The proximity accompanied by suppression of coherence takes place in an inhomogeneous way in the momentum space in finite-dimensional systems. Studies on instabilities of metals consisted of such differentiated electrons in the momentum space are reviewed from a general point of view. A typical example of the differentiation is found in the flattening of the quasiparticle dispersion discovered around momenta $(π,0)$ and $(0,π)$ on 2D square lattices. This flattening even controls the criticality of the metal-insulator transition. Such differentiation and suppressed coherence subsequently cause an instability to the superconducting state in the second order of the strong coupling expansion. The d-wave pairing interaction is generated from such local but kinetic processes in the absence of disturbance from the coherent single-particle excitations. The superconducting mechanism emerges from a direct kinetic origin which is conceptually different from the pairing mechanism mediated by bosonic excitations as in magnetic, excitonic, and BCS mechanisms. Pseudogap phenomena widely observed in the underdoped cuprates are then naturally understood from the mode-mode coupling of d-wave superconducting (dSC) fluctuations repulsively coupled with antiferromagnetic (AFM) ones. When we assume the existence of a strong d-wave channel repulsively competing with AFM fluctuations under the formation of flat and damped single-particle dispersion, we reproduce basic properties of the pseudogap seen in the magnetic resonance, neutron scattering, angle resolved photoemission and tunneling measurements in the cuprates.

113	Arxiv	Photoisomerization-coupled electron transfer	Jakub K. Sowa	2020-06-24	http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13896v2	Photochromic molecular structures constitute a unique platform for constructing molecular switches, sensors and memory devices. One of their most promising applications is as light-switchable electron acceptor or donor units. Here, we investigate a previously unexplored process that we postulate may occur in such systems: an ultrafast electron transfer triggered by a simultaneous photoisomerization of the donor or the acceptor moiety. We propose a theoretical model for this phenomenon and, with the aid of DFT calculations, apply it to the case of a dihydropyrene-type photochromic molecular donor. By considering the wavepacket dynamics and the photoisomerization yield, we show that the two processes involved, electron transfer and photoisomerization, are in general inseparable and need to be treated in a unified manner. We finish by discussing how the efficiency of photoisomerization-coupled electron transfer can be controlled experimentally.	Emily A. Weiss et Tamar Seideman	955

A qualitative step has been made with the recent generation of single charge levitons obtained by applying Lorentzian voltage pulse on the contact of the quantum conductor. Simple to realize and operate, the source emits electrons in the form of striking minimal excitation states called levitons. We review the striking properties of levitons and their possible applications in quantum physics to electron interferometry and entanglement. W Schematic generation of time resolved single charges called levitons using Lorentzian voltage pulses applied on a contact. A Quantum Point Contact is used to partition the levitons for further analysis. Injecting levitons on opposite contacts with a delay $\τ$ enables to probe electronic like Hong Ou Mandel correlations. Copyright line will be provided by the publisher 1 Single electron sources In this introduction, we will distinguish single charge sources from coherent single electrons sources. The former have been developed for quantum metrology where the goal is to transfer an integer charge at high frequency f through a conductor with good accuracy to realize a quantized current source whose current I = ef shows metrological accuracy. The latter, the coherent single electrons source, aims at emitting (injecting) a single electron whose wave-function is well defined and controlled to realize further single electron coherent manipulation via quantum gates. The gates are provided by electronic beam-splitters made with Quantum Point Contacts or provided by electronic Mach-Zehnder and Fabry-Prot interferometers. Here it is important that the injected single electron is the only excitation created in the conductor. The frequency f of injection is not chosen to have a large current, as current accuracy is not the goal, but only to get sufficient statistics on the electron transfer events to extract physical information. 1.1 single charge sources for current standards The first manipulation of single charges trace back to the early 90's where physicists took advantage of charge quan-tization of a submicronic metallic island nearly isolated from leads by tunnel barriers.

The proposed model unifies the strong-coupling predictions with known electron-photon interactions. Additionally, this work predicts a non-Columbic entanglement between freely propagating electrons. Since strong-coupling can map entanglements between photon pairs onto photon-electron pairs, it may harness electron beams for quantum communication, thus far exclusive to photons.	Aucun	573
116	Arxiv	The general traits of inelastic electron scattering by the adsorbed system	A. R.

Two peculiar channels of elastic electron consumption are highlighted, both related to the substrate core level excitation coupled separately with two particular electron transitions. The first channel affects the adsorbed layer and enables to reveal the valence state structure of the adsorbed species as well as the substrate DOS. The second one includes the multiple plasmon oscillations. The proposed mechanism of electron transitions assumes that one-dimensional DOS at the vacuum level is an additional spot for location of excited electrons, along with vacant DOS at the Fermi level. Observed phenomena are supposed to be a general regularity of electron-solid interaction and a useful tool for fingerprinting the adsorbed layer at molecular level.	V. M. Tapilin	934
117	Arxiv	New many-particle system consisting of electron pairs and holes in a two-dimensional crystal	Guo-Qiang Hai	2016-02-24	http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07484v2	When atoms are organized into a crystal, the single-electron energy levels of individual atoms form energy bands. However, there also exist electron-pair states in atoms. We found previously that the counterpart of these electron-pair states of individual atoms may survive in a two-dimensional square-lattice crystal. When the amplitude of the crystal potential is larger than a certain value, a metastable electron-pair band arises between the two lowest single-electron energy bands. In this paper, we demonstrate that the many-particle exchange-correlation corrections renormalize the energy bands and may stabilize the electron pairs for certain hole and electron-pair densities in the two-dimensional crystal. Therefore, depending upon the crystal potential and free carrier densities, there may exist a new many-particle system consisting of electron pairs and holes. Furthermore, we calculate the charge-density excitation spectrum in this new many-particle system.	Ladir Cândido	973
118	Arxiv	Electron bunch generation from a plasma photocathode	Aihua Deng	2019-07-01	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00875v1	Plasma waves generated in the wake of intense, relativistic laser or particle beams can accelerate electron bunches to giga-electronvolt (GeV) energies in centimetre-scale distances. This allows the realization of compact accelerators having emerging applications, ranging from modern light sources such as the free-electron laser (FEL) to energy frontier lepton colliders. In a plasma wakefield accelerator, such multi-gigavolt-per-metre (GV m$^{-1}$) wakefields can accelerate witness electron bunches that are either externally injected or captured from the background plasma. Here we demonstrate optically triggered injection and acceleration of electron bunches, generated in a multi-component hydrogen and helium plasma employing a spatially aligned and synchronized laser pulse. This ''plasma photocathode'' decouples injection from wake excitation by liberating tunnel-ionized helium electrons directly inside the plasma cavity, where these cold electrons are then rapidly boosted to relativistic velocities. The injection regime can be accessed via optical density down-ramp injection, is highly tunable and paves the way to generation of electron beams with unprecedented low transverse emittance, high current and 6D-brightness. This experimental path opens numerous prospects for transformative plasma wakefield accelerator applications based on ultra-high brightness beams.

119	Arxiv	Electron Beam Production by Pyroelectric Crystals	James D. Brownridge	2002-09-20	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0209079v1	Pyroelectric crystals are used to produce self-focused electron beams with energies greater than 170 keV. No high voltage power supply or electron gun is needed. The system works by simply changing the temperature of a crystal of LiNbO3 or LiTaO3 by about 100oC in dilute gas. Electron beam energy spectra as well as positive-ion-beam energy spectra and profiles are shown. A change in the crystal temperature of 100oC will cause a spontaneous change in polarization. The change in polarization will be manifested by a change in charge on the surface of the crystal. It is this uncompensated charge that produces the electric field, which accelerates the electrons, or the positive ions and gives rise to the plasma, which in turn focuses them. The source of the accelerated electrons or positive ions is gas molecules ionized near the crystal surface. When the crystal surface is negative electrons are accelerated away from it and positive ions are attracted to the surface. These positive ions reduce the net negative charge on the surface thereby reducing the electric field, which causes the electron energy to decrease over time even though the focal properties remain unchanged. When the surface is positive the reverse obtains and the positive ion beam energy decreases over time as well. We will present video clips, photographic and electronic data that demonstrate many of the characteristics and applications of these electron beams.	Stephen M. Shafroth	1445
