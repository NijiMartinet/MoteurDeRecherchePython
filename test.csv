Peter Quill (orange boy, age 6) was a genius troublemaker & sweet momma's boy who loved one-on-one time.  Gamora (black girl, age 6) was loving, outgoing, & not-so-bright but loveddd food.  Ember (calico girl, age 10) was a petite sweetheart who was fast & knew it as she loved to be chased. She loved hugs & her heated bed.	1158	372

25	Reddit	I made a lamp designed specifically for Germany’s biggest architectural problem	pasha-delaet	1763034582.0	https://v.redd.it/zs5pp5lo8z0g1	Hey everyone!   This is my latest 3D printing project — a lamp designed for rooms with slanted ceilings (Dachschrägen), which are *everywhere* in Germany.  I wanted something that fits perfectly on a shallow shelf under the roof slope — and of course, none of the store-bought lamps worked. So I modeled one myself.  The shade is printed with fuzzy skin for that cozy fabric texture, and the base is done in marble PLA (looks way fancier than it should for 6 euros/kg 😄).  You will need: an E14 socket, an E14 bulb, four M5 heat-set inserts, four 5 mm M5 flat-head bolts, and an electrical cable.  I’m genuinely happy with how it turned out — it finally feels like a lamp made *for* these weird walls instead of *despite* them.  And if you’re curious to see the full build (and a bit of fun storytelling), I made a video about the whole process — I like to think it turned out funny, and I really put a lot of time and love into it.   👉 [https://youtu.be/9rbW8IiOJN0](https://youtu.be/9rbW8IiOJN0)     Would love your feedback and critique!	148	1040
37	Reddit	Oliver Bearman’s race pace seems oddly correlated with countries that allow hormone-treated beef	_StarDust_0	1763029122.0	https://i.redd.it/g0g8d6ck201g1.png	Every time Bearman races in a country where hormone treated Beef is not restricted, he seems to have much better race. For countries that restrict usage of hormone treated beef, Bearman's average finishing position is P13 as compared to being in points when it is permitted. As for Netherlands, that guy committed credit card fraud, pretty sure he can smuggle in some beef ;)	282	375

48	Reddit	"PSA: What Embark did with skin prices is a negotiation tactic called ""anchoring"" I know this will get downvoted because many will fall for the PR move, but this is planned. $16 microtransactions do not belong in a $40 title. Period and here's why."	TheOnlyRealOne43	1763038328.0	https://i.imgur.com/28KlTKE.jpeg	"Anchoring is a super commonly used tactic. Here's the definition of it:  The anchoring negotiation tactic involves setting an initial price point to influence the final agreement. By making the first offer, a seller can set a high anchor, which influences the buyer's perception and makes subsequent concessions seem more reasonable. Conversely, a buyer can set a low anchor, like stating a maximum budget, to steer the negotiation in their favor. The first number presented acts as a mental reference point, impacting the entire bargaining range.   Basically, give us really high prices at the beginning of the game then go ""Oh we heard you guys! We lowered the prices by $5!"" to influence content creators to create content about it being ""unprecedented"" and to influence us, the consumers.  People in the comments will filter in and state ""They need money to continue making the game"" which is a false corpo-speak argument. Microtransactions became a thing in games to make F2P games possible. Games with a low bar to entry and will attract a larger playerbase, while betting that the average player will spend an X amount to keep development on going.  A $40 game has no reason to do this. Arc sold 4 million units already, has made hundreds of millions of dollars in initial sales alone and will ***continue*** to sell (how Pay-to-play games typically fund on going development, through marketing). We also have \*very\* close games we can compare this to.  Helldivers 2:  * $40 base price with $20 upgrade just like ARCraiders * Cheaper cosmetics ($5 for a skin + suit sometimes less cosmetics can also be mix and matched) * ***Earnable*** premium currency  As you can see, these practices are much more consumer-friendly. I'm not suggesting the removal of microtransactions but right now it's a very unfair price point still, especially considering the base price of the game ($40) and the fact currency isn't earnable.  Also I'd like to point out how all the earnable cosmetics outside of one in the game are just **incredibly** barebones. Everything cool goes into the store and that's not okay. I know there will be a huge portion of people who downvote this because of the honeymoon phase of the game, and the obvious PR move that Embark are doing, but I wanted to post this all the same."	1503	2299
53	Reddit	Why the Fuck Does Any Trump Maggot Think Protecting a Pedophilic Predator Makes Them Patriotic?	Kinks4Kelly	1763040264.0	https://i.redd.it/v5hx6vjvz01g1.jpeg	There is a malevolent cancer curled deep in the marrow of this nation and it is not simply the man they now worship as the Tainted Trumpet. It is the millions who grin through their own moral decomposition while allegations whisper around him like flies around carrion. The depravity is not just in the possibility that a powerful man might have exploited the vulnerable. The deeper sickness is in the way his followers shrug as if the suffering of children were some tedious inconvenience. Their indifference is so grotesque it almost feels supernatural and you find yourself whispering fuck just to remember what human decency sounds like.  These supporters puff themselves up as guardians of virtue yet treat the violation of innocence as a partisan rumour rather than a shattering moral line. They clutch their pearls over books in libraries while remaining serenely unmoved at the thought that their beloved Tainted Trumpet could be implicated in behaviour they would condemn anyone else for without hesitation. They offer excuses that rot on the tongue and pretend their Bible absolves them from giving a single damn about the young. So I ask again and I ask with contempt where Jesus supported sexual relations with minors in the Bible because their silence grows louder every time they choose loyalty over humanity.  What is most disturbing is how easily they trade compassion for cruelty. They hear allegations and laugh them off as though the pain of a child were a political talking point rather than a wound carved into a life. Their indifference is not passive. It is participation. Every time they wave a sign or cheer his name, they declare that the innocence of the vulnerable is worth less than their ego and their victory. It makes you want to spit the word fuck at the ground because nothing else captures the ugliness of their apathy.  And the final cruelty is this. They do not care. Not really. If evidence crawled out of the earth and begged for recognition, they would still kneel for the Tainted Trumpet because their identity depends on it. They have fused themselves to a man drowning in accusations and decided that protecting him matters more than protecting the young. That level of indifference is its own form of evil. It is the quiet, smiling kind. The kind that watches innocence burn and calls the flames freedom.	711	2348
54	Reddit	JWST may have finally found the Universe’s First Stars	Busy_Yesterday9455	1763014381.0	https://i.redd.it/7xvpnzzruy0g1.jpeg	      Astronomers have long theorized about the universe’s first stars—called Population III (Pop III) stars—which formed from pristine hydrogen and helium before any heavier elements existed.    [In a new study, Eli Visbal and colleagues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03842) report that the recently discovered object LAP1-B is the first observed system matching theoretical expectations for these ancient stars. Found by the James Webb Space Telescope and magnified by the galaxy cluster MACS J0416, LAP1-B lies about 13 billion light-years away (redshift 6.6).    Its spectrum shows strong hydrogen emission lines but almost no metal signatures, suggesting extremely low chemical enrichment. The object appears to host a compact cluster of massive, short-lived stars—roughly a few thousand times the Sun’s mass in total—residing within a dark-matter halo of about 50 million solar masses. Models indicate its surrounding gas has been slightly enriched by supernovae or stellar winds from these stars.    Using simulations, the researchers predict that observing one Pop III galaxy like LAP1-B in the magnified region of MACS J0416 is statistically expected, making its discovery consistent with cosmological theory. This finding provides the strongest evidence yet that astronomers are finally glimpsing the universe’s first generation of stars, bridging the gap between cosmic theory and direct observation.	591	1409

101	Arxiv	The electronic structure of cuprates from high energy spectroscopy	Mark S. Golden	2000-11-15T16:19:15Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0011267v1	We report studies of the electronic structure and elementary excitations of doped and undoped cuprate chains, ladders and planes. Using high energy spectroscopies such as x-ray absorption, core level photoemission and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy, important information regarding the charge distribution and hole dynamics can be obtained. The comparison of the experimental data with suitable theoretical models sets constraints on the parameters entering into the model calculations, and offers insight into the important physical quantities governing the electronic structure of these materials. Recurring themes include the importance of the dimensionality of the Cu-O network (1D->2D) and the crucial role played by the spin-background in determining the dynamics of low-lying excitations in these strongly correlated systems.

102	Arxiv	Surface effects on the electronic energy loss of charged particles entering a metal surface	A. Garcia-Lekue	2002-11-14T15:23:14Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0211289v1	Surface effects on the electronic energy loss of charged particles entering a metal surface are investigated within linear-response theory, in the framework of time-dependent density functional theory. Interesting phenomena occur in the loss spectra originated by the boundary (bregenzung) effect, which is as a consequence of the orthogonality of surface and bulk excitation modes. Our calculations indicate that the presence of a non-abrupt electron-density profile at the surface severely affects the nature of surface excitations, as deduced from comparison with simplified models.
